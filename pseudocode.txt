Tinder Profile Generator

Start w/ a set of functions that answer the basic questions, then make
a master function that contains/runs the others.  Start w/ just
asking questions and entering into a format in the master function.
Then, if there's time- get creative w/ it.

Basic rules:
-one player
-player provides input which is used to create profile
-program provides format & fun flair depending on player input.
-End result is a short profile for online dating

Nice to have:
-basic info on player 
	*name, age, basics of who they’re looking for
	*Interests (hobbies, music, food, etc…)
	*Physical descriptions & what they want.
	*multiple fun formats to fit it into (like a choose your own 	adventure).
	*A word/character limit so it has to end sometime.
	*Something to detect BS (bad answers).

Workflow:
-ask the user for basic info
-ask a few more personal questions to determine which profile template to run.
-based on that profile template, ask the questions needed to complete that profile.
-Once it’s complete- print the profile for the player.

Data to keep track of:
-player responses
-flow of how to get to which template
